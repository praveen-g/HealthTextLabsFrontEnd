Patient presented<br/>with <mark data-entity='problem'>headache</mark>, <mark data-entity='problem'>nuchal rigidity</mark>, <mark data-entity='problem'>expressive aphasia</mark>, <mark data-entity='problem'>afebrile on</mark><br/>admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to<br/>have <mark data-entity='problem'>rigors</mark>.  LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5%<br/>monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  CSF gram stain showed <mark data-entity='problem'>gram<br/>positive rods</mark>, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation<br/>eventually grew <mark data-entity='problem'>listeria</mark>. Empiric treatment based on gram stain<br/>was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and<br/>question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending<br/>confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  Once<br/>speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was<br/>started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.<br/>Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP<br/>[**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**10-3**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  Early on<br/>admission, she developed <mark data-entity='problem'>hypotension</mark> that required levophed, but<br/>was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of<br/>admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume<br/>resussitation.  Given <mark data-entity='problem'>bacteremia</mark>, TTE was done, no <mark data-entity='problem'>vegetations</mark><br/>or <mark data-entity='problem'>lesions</mark> noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial<br/>frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no <mark data-entity='problem'>hemorrhage</mark>.<br/>Subsequent MRI confirmed <mark data-entity='problem'>infarct</mark>, unclear date, and EEG<br/>consistent with <mark data-entity='problem'>meningitis</mark>.  Neurology was consulted, and the<br/>patient was placed on dilantin for <mark data-entity='problem'>seizure prophylaxis</mark> given<br/><mark data-entity='problem'>meningoencephalitis</mark>. She spiked <mark data-entity='problem'>fevers</mark> to 101-102 over the first<br/>several days of admission.  By [**10-1**], her neurological exam was<br/>markedly improved, and by [**10-3**] her <mark data-entity='problem'>headache</mark> was gone, no<br/>meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential <mark data-entity='problem'>tremor</mark><br/>was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined<br/>negative from [**9-29**] on.  Notably, she was transferred from ICU<br/>to floor on [**10-3**], but <mark data-entity='problem'>noninvasive BP</mark> was read as 60/d, patient<br/>mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line<br/>was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than<br/>sphyngomanometer.  This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but<br/>persistent.  Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine<br/>output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear<br/>reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  On<br/>[**10-5**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management.<br/>.<br/>#. Bilateral lung <mark data-entity='problem'>opacities</mark>/<mark data-entity='problem'>hypoxia</mark>. Initial chest film read as<br/>increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given<br/>steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs. <mark data-entity='problem'>bacterial pneumonia</mark> vs. <mark data-entity='problem'>pulmonary<br/>edema</mark>. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her<br/><mark data-entity='problem'>respiratory distress</mark> led to her being placed on CPAP+PS.  The<br/>origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be<br/>secondary to likely vascular leak from <mark data-entity='problem'>sepsis</mark>/<mark data-entity='problem'>CHF</mark> versus <mark data-entity='problem'>PCP</mark>. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]<br/>induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not<br/>repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and<br/>susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of <mark data-entity='problem'>PCP</mark> was small.  She<br/>responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements.<br/>.<br/>#. <mark data-entity='problem'>UC</mark>: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of<br/>prednisone, which was changed on [**10-4**] to dexamethasone IV; her<br/>outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with no <mark data-entity='problem'>diarrhea</mark>,<br/>it recurred on [**10-4**] soon after her diet had advanced. <mark data-entity='problem'>C.diff</mark> was<br/>negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest.  On<br/>[**10-6**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit<br/>was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and<br/>consent for blood transfusion.<br/>.<br/>#. <mark data-entity='problem'>Anemia</mark>. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She<br/>received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**10-1**] for mixed<br/>venous sat <70%.  She was found to have iron binding studies c/w<br/>anemia of chronic disease.  Her HCT was followed closely, and<br/>remained stable for the remainder of her admission.<br/>.<br/>#. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO<br/>with TPN on [**10-4**] after she developed <mark data-entity='problem'>diarrhea</mark>, thought secondary<br/>to continued UC activity.<br/>.<br/>#. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep, <mark data-entity='problem'>pneumoboots</mark>. Initially on<br/>droplet precautions.<br/>.<br/>#. Code status: FULL<br/>.<br/>#.

In animmunocompromised patient, this is concerning<br/>for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes<br/>pulmonaryedema. Additionally, there is afaintopacity at the<br/>right lung base, which may representatelectasis orfocal<br/>pneumonic process.<br/>.<br/>CT-Head [**9-28**]: Focus oflowattenuation within thesubcortical<br/>white matter of theright medial frontal lobe. This may<br/>represent asubacute infarction; however, an underlying mass<br/>lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with<br/>gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for<br/>further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted.<br/>.<br/>MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**9-30**]:<br/>Signalabnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving<br/>the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This<br/>finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in<br/>absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined.<br/>No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if<br/>clinically indicated.<br/>.<br/>Echo [**9-30**]:<br/>1.Theleft atrium ismildlydilated.<br/>2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left<br/>ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular<br/>wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic<br/>function is normal (LVEF>55%).<br/>3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are<br/>normal.<br/>4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with<br/>good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the<br/>aortic valve. There is noaortic valve stenosis. Traceaortic<br/>regurgitation is seen.<br/>5. Themitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or<br/>vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. While difficult to<br/>assess given the limited views suspect Mild (1+)mitral<br/>regurgitation is seen.<br/>6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.<br/>7.There is nopericardial effusion.<br/>.<br/>If clinically indicated, would recommend a TEE.<br/>.<br/>CXR [**10-3**]:<br/>Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral<br/>pleural effusions andbibasilar atelectasis<br/>.<br/>Studies:<br/>EEG [**9-29**]: This is a mildlyabnormal EEG due to the presence of<br/>a slow<br/>and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing -<br/>all<br/>consistent with a mildencephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or<br/>anoxic<br/>etiology. No evidence for ongoingseizures is seen.<br/><br/><br/>Brief Hospital Course:<br/>A/P:  54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC (prednisone,<br/>6MP) who presents with new onset HA,fever with bacterial<br/>meningitis andgram positive rod bacteremia.<br/>.<br/>#.Listeriosis -meningitis and bacteremia. Patient presented<br/>withheadache,nuchal rigidity,expressive aphasia,afebrile on<br/>admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to<br/>haverigors.  LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5%<br/>monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  CSF gram stain showedgram<br/>positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation<br/>eventually grewlisteria. Empiric treatment based on gram stain<br/>was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and<br/>question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending<br/>confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  Once<br/>speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was<br/>started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.<br/>Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP<br/>[**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**10-3**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  Early on<br/>admission, she developedhypotension that required levophed, but<br/>was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of<br/>admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume<br/>resussitation.  Givenbacteremia, TTE was done, novegetations<br/>orlesions noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial<br/>frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, nohemorrhage.<br/>Subsequent MRI confirmedinfarct, unclear date, and EEG<br/>consistent withmeningitis.  Neurology was consulted, and the<br/>patient was placed on dilantin forseizure prophylaxis given<br/>meningoencephalitis. She spikedfevers to 101-102 over the first<br/>several days of admission.  By [**10-1**], her neurological exam was<br/>markedly improved, and by [**10-3**] herheadache was gone, no<br/>meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essentialtremor<br/>was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined<br/>negative from [**9-29**] on.  Notably, she was transferred from ICU<br/>to floor on [**10-3**], butnoninvasive BP was read as 60/d, patient<br/>mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line<br/>was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than<br/>sphyngomanometer.  This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but<br/>persistent.  Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine<br/>output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear<br/>reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  On<br/>[**10-5**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management.<br/>.<br/>#. Bilateral lungopacities/hypoxia. Initial chest film read as<br/>increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given<br/>steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs.bacterial pneumonia vs.pulmonary<br/>edema. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her<br/>respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP+PS.  The<br/>origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be<br/>secondary to likely vascular leak fromsepsis/CHF versusPCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]<br/>induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not<br/>repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and<br/>susbsequent evaluation that likelihood ofPCP was small.  She<br/>responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements.<br/>.<br/>#.UC: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of<br/>prednisone, which was changed on [**10-4**] to dexamethasone IV; her<br/>outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with nodiarrhea,<br/>it recurred on [**10-4**] soon after her diet had advanced.C.diff was<br/>negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest.  On<br/>[**10-6**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit<br/>was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and<br/>consent for blood transfusion.<br/>.<br/>#.Anemia. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She<br/>received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**10-1**] for mixed<br/>venous sat <70%.  She was found to have iron binding studies c/w<br/>anemia of chronic disease.  Her HCT was followed closely, and<br/>remained stable for the remainder of her admission.<br/>.<br/>#. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO<br/>with TPN on [**10-4**] after she developeddiarrhea, thought secondary<br/>to continued UC activity.<br/>.<br/>#. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep,pneumoboots. Initially on<br/>droplet precautions.<br/>.<br/>#. Code status: FULL<br/>.<br/>#. Communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother<br/>.<br/>#. Lines: peripheral IV x 2. left subclavian CC.  A-line. Eval<br/>for PICC; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line.<br/><br/>Surgery Discharge part:<br/>Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on<br/>[**2823-10-8**].  She was on Clinda/Gent peri-procedure and Amplicillin<br/>for 21 days at first.  She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until<br/>the ostomy started to function.  SHe had c/o nausea as diet was<br/>tolerated and it was slowed down.  MRI was suspicious for an<br/>abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6<br/>weeks as per ID.  She was given a PICC.
